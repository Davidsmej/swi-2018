## SWI 1

These are materials for the [Software Engineering 1](http://is.mendelu.cz/katalog/syllabus.pl?kod=PEF:SWI1) course, taught on Mendel University in Brno, fall 2018.

The intro lecture takes place on Monday 2018-09-24, 9:00.

There are 2 study groups:

   * starting on 2018-09-27 (every 2 weeks, odd weeks), led by @ZitaNemeckova and @himdel
   * starting on 2018-10-04 (every 2 weeks, even weeks), led by @lpichler and @Hyperkid123


The topic will be Git, the whole semester.

A VM image will be available (TODO: link) so that everybody can get the same environment.


Synopsis:

1. History, thy why, what?  
  - `git log` - show what's what
  - (get the VM running)

2. Basics - `init`/`clone`, `git config`  
  - commits
  - branches

3. Synchronization - remotes, updating (pull vs fetch & merge...)

4. Conflicts  
  - branches (continued)
  - merge
  - rebase

5. `git rebase -i` - more real examples, get to try everything

6. (backup) - Advanced GIT topics - aliases, scripting, more configuration, .git directory structure  
  (There may not be a 6th lesson, depending on the calendar.)

The course will be followed by [Software Engineering 2](https://is.mendelu.cz/katalog/syllabus.pl?kod=PEF:SWI2).

Lessons will take place every week, in a workshop-like episodic fashion.

Preliminary list of topics:

* UX design
* refactoring
* ORM (and databases)
* various ways of testing
* other aspects of software development, focusing on real world examples
